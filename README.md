# DS-100-final
analysis of crytocurrency data

TODO:
- I've compared the coorelation between bitcoin and 2 other stock exhchange indicies, hopefuly we could add a few more
- Make a Multiple Linear Regression model that takes in Stock Exchange Indicies and maps them to bitcoin price
- add technical indicators

working version of the projec is Bitcoinprediction.ipyd

I added a Multiple Linear Regression that takes in Month, Weighted Volume of bitcoin being exhcanged, as well a few Stock exhchange tickers and maps them to the price of Bitcoin on that day. Interesting findings are that price is highest in winter months, the coefficent most valued by the regression are one hot encoded times of months, and that the models tends to overpredict from 2016-2019, probably because of the rapid rise in price over time. Let me know if you have any suggestions as for what we should add, or if we should just begin to create the final product.

It all looks super good I think we should just put it all in the final product now
